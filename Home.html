                    <p> It was a normal Thursday afternoon, I was sitting at my comfy couch watching tv, eating a packet of cheese and onion crisps, and thinking about the story my friend Sam told me … there is a mysterious cave on the other side of that hill… I glanced through the window, where the hill was resting peacefully … guarded by snakes, filled with diamonds and emeralds… Emeralds? What are they? I grabbed my trusty Encyclopaedia and I found out that they were beautifully engraved crystals with a green tinge to it. Just in a flash, the electricity went off.

                    <p>I woke up from my deep sleep, or my grandmother woke me up from my deep sleep, for they did not know what disastrous things I experienced last night. 
                    </p>
                    <p>It was a damp breezy night, a light smell travelled through my nostrils. Frogs  were croaking in the music of the raindrops dancing on the floor and palm trees were dancing to the beat of the wind. Those drops  after reduced to a small amount of water, rolled down to the side of our house, creating a shiny puddle. Rain had started flowing like small teardrops after a long, beautiful summer.  As the frogs croaked a safe distance away from me,(the distance enough to not make them accidently jump on my body while sleeping) I enjoyed the misty breeze, which was making the plants sway back and forth. While I was beginning to fall asleep in my hard bed, I heard some pleasing drum music outside. Even though it was strange, I liked the music. After hearing that, I gained consciousness. What is that?, I thought, And why am I listening to it? Then I realised something. Those were not music. They were footsteps.
